I walk the city late at night
Does everyone here do the same?
I want to be the things I see
Give every face and place my name
I cross the street, take a right
Pick up the pace, pass a fight
Did I grow up just to stay home?
I'm not immune, I love this tune
I wanna love more
I just wanna love more
I wanna love more
I just wanna love more
I wanna love more
I just wanna love more
I wanna love more
I just wanna love more
I drag the city late at night
It's in my mouth, it's in my hair
The people fill the city because
The city fills the people, oh yeah
I cross the street avoid the freeze
A city's warmer by a couple of degrees
The smell of food the smell of rain
I'm not immune, I love this tune
I wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I just wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I just wanna love more
I wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I just wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I wanna love more
(There's a river in my head)
I just wanna love more
The only way out is down
The only way up is down
The day's roll by like thunder
Like a storm that's never breaking
All my time and space compressed
In the low pressure of proceedings
And they beat against the sides of my life
Like fist against inside, in my life
And the roads all lead behind me
So I wrap the wheel around me
And I go out
There's a river in my head
There's a river in my head
There's a river in my head
I'll take you home and make it easy
(There's a river in my head)
(There's a river in my head)
I'll take you home and make it easy
(There's a river in my head)
Love more
Love more
Love more
Love more
